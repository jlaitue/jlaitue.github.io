Projects
======
<!-- * **Integration of AI algorithms in a robotic car** *Personal project* (Ongoing)
  * Raspberry Pi robotic car in which algorithms of computer vision, voice recognition, reinforcement learning and 360° video feed are combined to serve as an autonomous vehicle capable of learning, reacting to and exploring environments with virtual reality.

* **Website for restaurants of Paris by arrondissement** *Personal project* (Ongoing)
  * Simple website for filtering restaurants in Paris by arrondissement, neighbourhood, type of food and price. Despite this information being available by Google it is hard to find a website that filters all restaurants by these categories.

* **Block chain token for academic recommendation letters** *Personal project* (Ongoing)
  * Applications to graduate programs require a lot of work and time to prepare. One of the most time consuming and hard tasks is contacting professors that agree to give you recommendation letters. With this in mind, blockchain tokens can be used to validate an academic's support to a candidate without the need of constantly updating the recommender's information. -->

* **Photovoltaic data driven analysis: data cleaning, computer vision and losses estimation** (2021)
  - *TotalEnergies Paris, France*
  * Time series analysis of photo voltaic energy plants from TotalEnergies. Analysis of energy losses for prediction of soiling effects in solar panels. Implementation of a statistical clear sky algorithm for ideal production prediction. Tree detection and distance calculation to ceilings in aerial images using computer vision techniques for solar panel placement.

* **Formula 1 Data Analysis using Graph Data Bases** (2021)
  - *Master's degree project for course "Advanced Data Bases" Université de Paris Paris, France*
  * Using Neo4j graph database system I analyzed the information of Formula 1 championships, drivers, venues and their relationships along the years.

* **New York City Taxi Data Analysis** (2020)
  - *Master's degree project for course "Big Data" Université de Paris Paris, France*
  * Analysis of New City Taxi dataset to understand and implement algorithms and frameworks for massive datasets. Insight into different patterns of movement between the 5 buroughs of New York City and transport routes within the airports of the city.

* **Heartbeat pre-diagnostic mobile application** (2018)
  - *Yamamoto Human Computer Interaction Laboratory KIT Kanazawa, Japan*
  * iOS mobile application using deep learning for analyzing heartbeat sounds to detect cardiovascular anomalies and displaying the results using an augmented reality interface.

* **Automated control algorithm for inhabitable spaces using emotional domotics** (2016)
  - *Computing Intelligence Mechatronics and BioDesign Laboratory CIMB  ITESM Mexico City, Mexico*
  * Final integrator project to obtain the B.s in mechatronics engineering. Closed loop automatic control algorithm using neural networks for a domotic space in which the emotional state of a user is measured and improved. Input data is obtained via EEG, skin sensors, ECG and face recognition. The output of the control algorithm sets environmental variables to modify temperature, light, sound and image in an effort to improve a user's emotional state.

* **Growth techniques for 2D nanomaterials crystals** (2016)
  - *Walter Schottky Institut TUM Munich, Germany*
  * Laboratory project for understanding and implementing techniques for crystal production of 2D carbon based nanomaterials.
